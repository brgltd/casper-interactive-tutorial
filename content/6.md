We can create flexible projects with the <a href="https://docs.casperlabs.io/dapp-dev-guide/tutorials/multi-sig/concepts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multi-signature features</a> in Casper at the account level by signing from one account with multiple keys. The **associated keys** are a set of public keys allowed to provide signatures on account actions.

An account can receive new keys and each key can have a weight and a set of thresholds that can be configured to implement key management.

We can compose validation logic with the pattern matching in Rust to create useful features with just a few lines of code. The following listing shows how to remove add a key. Note the usage of the **account** from **casper_contract**.

```rust
use casper_contract::{contract_api::{runtime, storage, account}};

// Add/update.
match account::update_associated_key(account_hash, weight) {
    Ok(()) => Ok(()),
    Err(UpdateKeyFailure::MissingKey) => add_key(account_hash, weight),
    Err(UpdateKeyFailure::PermissionDenied) => Err(Error::PermissionDenied),
    Err(UpdateKeyFailure::ThresholdViolation) => Err(Error::ThresholdViolation),
}
```

Removing keys is also seamlessly with the usage of casper_contracts. We can use the same fallbacks from the previous listing, including missing key, permission and threshold errors.

```rust
// Remove a key is it exists.
match account::remove_associated_key(account_hash) {
    Ok(()) => Ok(()),
    Err(RemoveKeyFailure::MissingKey) => Ok(()),
    Err(RemoveKeyFailure::PermissionDenied) => Err(Error::PermissionDenied),
    Err(RemoveKeyFailure::ThresholdViolation) => Err(Error::ThresholdViolation),
}
```

We can pass the permission level to handle thresholds. This way, we can create dapps where the account thresholds can have weights which must be meet to performn actions inside an application.

```rust
// Config threshold.
match account::set_action_threshold(level, threshold) {
    Ok(()) => Ok(()),
    Err(SetThresholdFailure::KeyManagementThreshold) => Err(Error::KeyManagementThreshold),
    Err(SetThresholdFailure::DeploymentThreshold) => Err(Error::DeploymentThreshold),
    Err(SetThresholdFailure::PermissionDeniedError) => Err(Error::PermissionDenied),
    Err(SetThresholdFailure::InsufficientTotalWeight) => Err(Error::InsufficientTotalWeight),
```

## Challenge

Complete the functions **add_or_update_key**, **remove_key_if_exists** and **set_threshold** to handle key management in a smart contract.
