title: Contract Skeleton

The smallest Casper Smart Contract defines a function named **call** with a **no_mangle** attribute.

The result of a Casper smart contract consists of wasm files and the annotation is necessary to prevent the function name being changed during compilation.

```rust
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn call() {}
```

Additional attributes are necessary in order to build a simple contract.

We need to specity a **no_str** environment and a **no_main** definition, both for the whole crate. Note the ! after the # for the attributes.

```rust
#![no_std]
#![no_main]
```

Lastly, we should handle a scenario where the contract is executed with a target architecture different than wasm32. One method to achieve this is to provide a compilation error.

```rust
#[cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))]
compile_error!("expected target arch is wasm32");
```

## Challenge

Write a skeleton for a Casper Smart Contract, with the attribute **no_str** first, followed by **no_main**, followed by the **wasm32** architecture detection.

If the contract is not executed on wasm32, provide the following error message:
**"expected target arch is wasm32"**.
