Casper allows the development of NFTs through the **CEP-47 Standard** to manage and trade unique tokens. CEP-74 supports the unique trais and advantages of the Casper VM.

This article is aiming for a explanation of the Rust smart contracts. If you're looking the JavaScript API to consume existing contracts, check the

One of the main concerns when minting NFTs is to perform the correct set of validation to ensure that the operation is valid. For instance, ensuring that the item are unique and that the list of ids match have a metadata.

The following listing demonstrates the pseudo code to check the size of set of token ids with a set of provided metadata list, and how to check if the item is unique.

```rust
if ids.len() != metas.len() {
    return Err(Error::WrongArguments);
}
for id in &ids {
    if Owners::instance().get(&id).is_some() {
        return Err(Error::TokenIdAlreadyExists);
    }
}
```

The process of updating the total supply, emitting the event (which can be captured on the frontend app), and returning the successfull operation is demonstrated on the following listing.

```rust
fn mint_emit() -> Result<Vec<TokenId>> {
    data::set_total_supply(new_total_supply);
    self.emit(CEP47Event::Mint {
        recipient,
        ids.clone(),
    });
    Ok(ids)
}
```

## Challenge

Complete the program to validate the arguments and check if an item is unique.

Next, finish writing the code to emit the event and return a successful IO operation.
