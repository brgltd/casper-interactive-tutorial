title: Storing Values

To store a value into the through Casper Smart Contracts, we need to to defined a **unforgeable reference (uref)** for the value.

For example, for a contract that expects a single runtime argument named "message", we can declare this value in a constant and save it by using **storage::new_uref**.

```rust
use casper_contract::{
    contract_api::{runtime, storage},
};

const ARG_NAME: &str = "message";
let value: String = runtime::get_named_arg(ARG_NAME);
let value_ref = storage::new_uref(value;
```

Next, we need to wrap the reference in a key, by using with the **.into()** method.

Also, to save the value, we make can use the **runtime::put_key** method and pass the key.

```rust
const KEY_NAME: &str = "my_key";
let value_key: Key = value_ref.into();
runtime::put_key(KEY_NAME, value_key);
```

Casper comes with a rich type system. Therefore, we can use the **URef** and **Key** types.

To use the String type from rust, we need to use **alloc**, since the we're into a no_str environment.

```rust
extern crate alloc;
use alloc::string::String;

use casper_types::{Key, URef};

let value_ref: URef = storage::new_uref(value);
let value_key: Key = value_ref.into();
```

## Challenge

Complete the program to store a value on the blockchain.

The key need to have the following name: **"blockchain_city"**.
