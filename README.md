## Highlights

- Live coding challenges to be completed in a text editor.
- Share on social media with just one click.
- Content is consumed through markdown to allow easy maintenance.

## Short Description

The project emphasis is to develop smart contracts in Casper using the Rust programming language.

The emphasis is not on how to setup local environments or configurations.

Rather, it's to get familiar on some of the concepts needed to develop Casper Smart Contracts in Rust.

## How to run the project locally

```bash
npm install

npm run dev
```

## How to add more content

More content can be added by adding new markdown files inside the content/ directory.

Additionaly, to add the initial code snippet inside the editor and the expected result, new files can be added inside content-metadata/initial-values/ and content-metadata/expected-values/, respectively.
